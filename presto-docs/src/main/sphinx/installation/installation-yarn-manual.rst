Manual Installation on a YARN-Based Cluster
===========================================

You can use `Apache Slider`_. to manually install Presto on a YARN-based cluster.

Deploying Presto on a YARN-Based Cluster
========================================

The installation procedures assume that you have a basic knowledge of Presto
and the configuration files and properties it uses.

.. note::

Pre-Requisites
--------------

-  A cluster with HDP 2.2+ or CDH5.4+ installed
-  Apache Slider 0.80.0 (download from https://slider.incubator.apache.org/)
-  JDK 1.8
-  Zookeeper
-  openssl >= 1.0.1e-16

  .. _Package: https:www.teradata.com/presto

Presto Installation Directory Structure
---------------------------------------

When you use Slider to install Presto on a YARN-based cluster, the Presto 
installation directory structure differs from the standard structure.

For more information, see:
| :doc:`Presto Installation Directory Structure for YARN-Based Clusters <installation-yarn-directory-structure>`

-----

Presto Installation Configuration Options
-----------------------------------------

Before installation, you must configure the .json files required for running Presto.

For more information, see:
| :doc:`Presto Configuration Options for YARN-Based Clusters <installation-yarn-configuration-options>`

Using Apache Slider to Manually Install Presto on a YARN-Based Cluster
======================================================================

1. Download the slider 0.80.0 installation file from
   http://slider.incubator.apache.org/index.html to one of your nodes in
   the cluster

::

    tar -xvf slider-0.80.0-incubating-all.tar.gz

2. Now configure Slider with JAVA\_HOME and HADOOP\_CONF\_DIR in
   ``slider-0.80.0-incubating/conf/slider-env.sh``

::

    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java
    export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/etc/hadoop/conf

3. Configure zookeeper in ``conf/slider-client.xml``. In case zookeper
   is listening on ``master:2181`` you need to add there the following
   section:

::

      <property>
          <name>slider.zookeeper.quorum</name>
          <value>master:2181</value>
      </property>

4. Configure path where slider packages will be installed

::

      <property>
        <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
        <value>hdfs://master/</value>
      </property>

5. Make sure the user running slider, which should be same as
   ``site.global.app_user`` in ``appConfig.json``, has a home dir in
   HDFS (See note `here <#appconfig-json>`__).

.. code-block:: none

    su hdfs
    $ hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/<user>
    $ hdfs dfs -chown <user>:<user> -R /user/<user>

6. Now run slider as

For more details on `appConfig.json <#appconfig-json>`__ and
`resources.json <#resources-json>`__ follow `configuration <#advanced-configuration>`__
section.

::

    su <user>
    cd slider-0.80.0-incubating
    bin/slider package --install --name PRESTO --package ../presto-yarn-package-*.zip
    bin/slider create presto1 --template appConfig.json --resources resources.json (using modified .json files as per your requirement)

This should start your application, and you can see it under the Yarn
ResourceManager webUI.If your application is successfully run, it should continuously be available in the 
YARN resource manager as a "RUNNING" application. If the job fails, please be sure to check the job history's logs 
along with the logs on the node's disk (more information `here <#debugging-and-logging>`__).

-----

Additional Slider Commands
--------------------------

You can use the following Slider commands to manage your existing Presto
application.

Check the status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to check the status of running application you run the
following, and you will have status printed to a file ``status_file``

::

    bin/slider status presto1 --out status_file

Destroy the App and Re-create
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to re-create the app due to some failures or you want to
reconfigure Presto (eg: add a new connector)

::

    bin/slider destroy presto1
    bin/slider create presto1 --template appConfig.json --resources resources.json

Completely remove the app
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Delete the app including the app package.


::

     bin/slider package --delete --name PRESTO

'Flex'ible app
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Flex the number of Presto workers to the new value. If greater than
before, new copies of the worker will be requested. If less, component
instances will be destroyed.

Changes are immediate and depend on the availability of resources in the
YARN cluster. Make sure while flex that there are extra nodes
available(if adding) with YARN nodemanagers running and also Presto data
directory pre-created/owned by ``yarn`` user. Also make sure these nodes
do not have a Presto component already running, which may cause flex-ing
to deploy worker on these nodes and eventually failing.

eg: Asumme there are 2 nodes (with YARN nodemanagers running) in the
cluster and you initially deployed only one of the nodes with Presto via
Slider. If you want to deploy and start Presto WORKER component on the
second node (assuming it meets all resource requirements) and thus have
the total number of WORKERS to be 2, then run:

::

    bin/slider flex presto1 --component WORKER 2

Please note that if your cluster already had 3 WORKER nodes running, the
above command will destroy one of them and retain 2 WORKERs.

Advanced Configuration Options
------------------------------

The following advanced configuration options are available:

+ Configuring memory, CPU, and YARN CGroups
+ Failure policy
+ YARN label
