==============
Hive Connector
==============

The Hive connector allows querying data stored in a Hive
data warehouse. Hive is a combination of three components:

* Data files in varying formats that are typically stored in the
  Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or in Amazon S3.
* Metadata about how the data files are mapped to schemas and tables.
  This metadata is stored in a database such as MySQL and is accessed
  via the Hive metastore service.
* A query language called HiveQL. This query language is executed
  on a distributed computing framework such as MapReduce or Tez.

Presto only uses the first two components: the data and the metadata.
It does not use HiveQL or any part of Hive's execution environment.

Configuration
-------------

Presto includes Hive connectors for multiple versions of Hadoop:

* ``hive-hadoop2``: Apache Hadoop 2.x
* ``hive-cdh5``: Cloudera CDH 5

Create ``/etc/presto/catalog/hive.properties`` with the following contents
to mount the ``hive-hadoop2`` connector as the ``hive`` catalog,
replacing ``hive-hadoop2`` with the proper connector for your version
of Hadoop and ``example.net:9083`` with the correct host and port
for your Hive metastore Thrift service:

.. code-block:: none

    connector.name=hive-hadoop2
    hive.metastore.uri=thrift://example.net:9083

Multiple Hive Clusters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can have as many catalogs as you need, so if you have additional
Hive clusters, simply add another properties file to ``/etc/presto/catalog``
with a different name (making sure it ends in ``.properties``). For
example, if you name the property file ``sales.properties``, Presto
will create a catalog named ``sales`` using the configured connector.

HDFS Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For basic setups, Presto configures the HDFS client automatically and
does not require any configuration files. In some cases, such as when using
federated HDFS or NameNode high availability, it is necessary to specify
additional HDFS client options in order to access your HDFS cluster. To do so,
add the ``hive.config.resources`` property to reference your HDFS config files:

.. code-block:: none

    hive.config.resources=/etc/hadoop/conf/core-site.xml,/etc/hadoop/conf/hdfs-site.xml

Only specify additional configuration files if necessary for your setup.
We also recommend reducing the configuration files to have the minimum
set of required properties, as additional properties may cause problems.

The configuration files must exist on all Presto nodes. If you are
referencing existing Hadoop config files, make sure to copy them to
any Presto nodes that are not running Hadoop.

Accessing Hadoop clusters protected with Kerberos authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Kerberos authentication is currently supported for both HDFS and the Hive
metastore.

However there are still a few limitations:

* Kerberos authentication is only supported for the ``hive-hadoop2`` and
  ``hive-cdh5`` connectors.
* Kerberos authentication by ticket cache is not yet supported.

The properties that apply to Hive connector security are listed in the
`Configuration Properties`_ table. Please see the
:doc:`/connector/hive-security` section for a more detailed discussion of the
security options in the Hive connector.

HDFS Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before running any ``CREATE TABLE`` or ``CREATE TABLE ... AS`` statements
for Hive tables in Presto, you need to check that the operating system user
running the Presto server has access to the Hive warehouse directory on HDFS. The Hive warehouse
directory is specified by the configuration variable ``hive.metastore.warehouse.dir``
in ``hive-site.xml``, and the default value is ``/user/hive/warehouse``. If that
is not the case, either add the following to ``jvm.config`` on all of the nodes:
``-DHADOOP_USER_NAME=USER``, where ``USER`` is an operating system user that has proper
permissions for the Hive warehouse directory, or start the Presto server as a user with
similar permissions. The ``hive`` user generally works as ``USER``, since Hive is often
started with the ``hive`` user. If you run into HDFS permissions problems on
``CREATE TABLE ... AS``, remove ``/tmp/presto-*`` on HDFS, fix the user as described
above, then restart all of the Presto servers.

================================================== ============================================================ ==========
``hive.metastore.uri``                             The URI(s) of the Hive metastore to connect to using the
                                                   Thrift protocol. If multiple URIs are provided, the first
                                                   URI is used by default and the rest of the URIs are
                                                   fallback metastores. This property is required.
                                                   Example: ``thrift://192.0.2.3:9083`` or
                                                   ``thrift://192.0.2.3:9083,thrift://192.0.2.4:9083``

``hive.config.resources``                          An optional comma-separated list of HDFS
                                                   configuration files. These files must exist on the
                                                   machines running Presto. Only specify this if
                                                   absolutely necessary to access HDFS.
                                                   Example: ``/etc/hdfs-site.xml``

                                                   DataNode process serving the split data.  This is useful for
                                                   installations where Presto is collocated with every
                                                   DataNode.

``hive.allow-drop-table``                          Allow the Hive connector to drop tables.                     ``false``

``hive.metastore.service.principal``               The Kerberos principal of the Hive metastore service.

``hive.metastore.client.principal``                The Kerberos principal that Presto will use when connecting
                                                   to the Hive metastore service.

``hive.hdfs.presto.keytab``                        HDFS client keytab location.
================================================== ============================================================ ==========

Amazon S3 Configuration
-----------------------

The Hive connector also allows querying data stored in Amazon S3.

To access tables stored in S3, you must specify the AWS credential properties 
``hive.s3.aws-access-key`` and ``hive.s3.aws-secret-key``. Alternatively, you can use
``hive.s3.use-instance-credentials`` which if set to true, enables retrieving temporary
`instance profile <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSdkDocsJava/latest/DeveloperGuide/java-dg-roles.html>`_
AWS credentials.

SQL Limitation for S3 tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The SQL support for S3 tables is the same as for HDFS tables. Presto does not support creating external
tables in Hive (both HDFS and S3). If you want to create a table in Hive with data in S3, you have to do it from
`Hive <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveAws+HivingS3nRemotely>`_.

Also, ``CREATE TABLE..AS query``, where ``query`` is a ``SELECT`` query on the S3 table will not create the table
on S3. If you want to load data back to S3, you need to use ``INSERT INTO`` command.

================================================== ============================================================ ==========

Querying Hive Tables
--------------------

The following table is an example Hive table from the `Hive Tutorial`_.
It can be created in Hive (not in Presto) using the following
Hive ``CREATE TABLE`` command:

.. _Hive Tutorial: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Tutorial#Tutorial-UsageandExamples

.. code-block:: none

    hive> CREATE TABLE page_view (
        >   viewTime INT,
        >   userid BIGINT,
        >   page_url STRING,
        >   referrer_url STRING,
        >   ip STRING COMMENT 'IP Address of the User')
        > COMMENT 'This is the page view table'
        > PARTITIONED BY (dt STRING, country STRING)
        > STORED AS SEQUENCEFILE;
    OK
    Time taken: 3.644 seconds

Assuming that this table was created in the ``web`` schema in
Hive, this table can be described in Presto::

    DESCRIBE hive.web.page_view;

.. code-block:: none

        Column    |  Type   | Null | Partition Key |        Comment
    --------------+---------+------+---------------+------------------------
     viewtime     | bigint  | true | false         |
     userid       | bigint  | true | false         |
     page_url     | varchar | true | false         |
     referrer_url | varchar | true | false         |
     ip           | varchar | true | false         | IP Address of the User
     dt           | varchar | true | true          |
     country      | varchar | true | true          |
    (7 rows)

This table can then be queried in Presto::

    SELECT * FROM hive.web.page_view;


.. _tuning-pref-hive:

Tuning
-------

The following configuration properties may have an impact on connector performance:

``hive.assume-canonical-partition-keys``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``Boolean``
 * **Default value:** ``false``
 * **Description:** Enable optimized metastore partition fetching for non-string partition keys. Setting this property allows to filter non-string partition keys while reading them from hive, based on the assumption that they are stored in canonical (java) format. This is disabled by default as hive allows to use non-canonical format as well (eg. boolean value ``false`` may be represented as ``0``, ``false``, ``False`` and more). Used correctly this property may drastically improve read time by reducing number of partition loaded from hive. Setting this property for non-canonical data format may cause erratic behavior.


``hive.domain-compaction-threshold``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``Integer`` (at least ``1``)
 * **Default value:** ``100``
 * **Description:** Maximum number of ranges/values allowed while reading hive data without compacting it. A higher value will cause more data fragmentation but allow the use of the row skipping feature when reading ORC data. Increasing this value may have a large impact on ``IN`` and ``OR`` clause performance in scenarios making use of row skipping.


.. _force-local-scheduling:

``hive.force-local-scheduling``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``Boolean``
 * **Default value:** ``false``
 * **Description:** Force splits to be scheduled on the same node (ignoring normal node selection procedures) as the Hadoop DataNode process serving the split data. This is useful for installations where Presto is collocated with every DataNode and may increase queries time significantly. The drawback may be that if some data are accessed more often, the utilization of some nodes may be low even if the whole system is heavy loaded. See also :doc:`node-scheduler.network-topology <../admin/tuning>` if less strict constrain is preferred - especially if some nodes are overloaded and other are not fully utilized.


``hive.max-initial-split-size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``String`` (data size)
 * **Default value:** ``hive.max-split-size`` / ``2`` (``32 MB``)
 * **Description:** This property describes the maximum size of the first ``hive.max-initial-splits`` splits created for a query. the logic behind initial splits is described in ``hive.max-initial-splits``. Lower values will increase concurrency for small queries. This property represents the maximum size, as the real size may be lower when the amount of data to read is less than ``hive.max-initial-split-size`` (e.g. at the end of a block on a DataNode).


``hive.max-initial-splits``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``Integer``
 * **Default value:** ``200``
 * **Description:** This property describes how many splits may be initially created for a single query using ``hive.max-initial-split-size`` instead of ``hive.max-split-size``. A higher value will force more splits to have a smaller size (``hive.max-initial-splits`` is expected to be smaller than ``hive.max-split-size``), effectively increasing the definition of what is considered a "small query". The purpose of the smaller split size for the initial splits is to increase concurrency for smaller queries.


``hive.max-outstanding-splits``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``Integer`` (at least ``1``)
 * **Default value:** ``1000``
 * **Description:** Limit on the nubmer of splits waiting to be served by a split source. After reaching this limit, writers will stop writing new splits until some of hteme are used by workers. Higher values will increase memory usage, but allow IO to be concentrated at one time, which may be faster and increase resource utilization.


``hive.max-partitions-per-writers``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``Integer`` (at least ``1``)
 * **Default value:** ``100``
 * **Description:** Maximum number of partitions per writer. A query will fail if it requires more partitions per writer than allowed by this property. It can be helpful to have queries beyond the expected maximum partitions to fail to help with error detection. Also it may allow to preactivly avoid out of memory problem.


``hive.max-split-iterator-threads``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``Integer`` (at least ``1``)
 * **Default value:** ``1000``
 * **Description:** This property describes how many threads may be used to iterate through splits when loading them to the worker nodes. A higher value may increase parallelism, but increased concurrency may cause too much time to be spent on context switching.


``hive.max-split-size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``String`` (data size)
 * **Default value:** ``64 MB``
 * **Description:** The maximum size of splits created after the initial splits. The logic for initial splits is described in ``hive.max-initial-splits``. A higher value will reduce parallelism. This may be desirable for very large queries and a stable cluster because it allows for more efficient processing of local data without the context switching, synchronization and data collection that result from parallelization. The optimal value should be aligned with the average query size in the system.


``hive.metastore.partition-batch-size.max``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``Integer`` (at least ``1``)
 * **Default value:** ``100``
 * **Description:** This together with ``hive.metastore.partition-batch-size.min`` defines the range of partition sizes read from Hive. The first partition is always of size ``hive.metastore.partition-batch-size.min`` and each following partition is two times bigger than previous up to ``hive.mestastore.partition-batch-size.max`` (the formula for partition size ``n`` is min(``hive.metastore.partition-batch-size.max``, (``2``^``n``) * ``hive.metastore.partition-batch-size.min``)). This algorithm allows for live adjustment of partition size according to the processing requirements. If the queries in the system will differ significantly from each other in size, then this range should be extended to better adjust to processing requirements. If the queries in the system will mostly be of the same size, then setting both values to the same maximally tuned value may give a slight edge in processing time.


``hive.metastore.partition-batch-size.min``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``Integer`` (at least ``1``)
 * **Default value:** ``10``
 * **Description:** See ``hive.metastore.partition-batch-size.max``.


``hive.orc.max-buffer-size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``String`` (data size)
 * **Default value:** ``8 MB``
 * **Description:** Serves as default value for ``orc_max_buffer_size`` session properties defining max size of ORC read operators. Higher value will allow bigger chunks to be processed but will decrease concurrency level.


``hive.orc.max-merge-distance``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``String`` (data size)
 * **Default value:** ``1 MB``
 * **Description:** Serves as the default value for the ``orc_max_merge_distance`` session property. Two reads from an ORC file may be merged into a single read if the distance between the requested data ranges in the data source is less than or equal to this value.


``hive.orc.stream-buffer-size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``String`` (data size)
 * **Default value:** ``8 MB``
 * **Description:** Serves as the default value for the ``orc_max_buffer_size`` session property. It defines the maximum size of ORC read operators. A higher value will allow bigger chunks to be processed, but will decrease concurrency.


``hive.orc.use-column-names``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``Boolean``
 * **Default value:** ``false``
 * **Description:** Access ORC columns using names from the file. By default, Hive access columns in ORC files using the order recoded in the Hive metastore. Setting this property allows to use columns names recorded in the ORC file instead.


.. _parquet-optimized-reader:

``hive.parquet-optimized-reader.enabled``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``Boolean``
 * **Default value:** ``false``
 * **Description:** *Deprecated* Serves as default value for ``parquet_optimized_reader_enabled`` session property. Enables number of reader improvements introduced by alternative parquet implementation. The new reader supports vectorized reads, lazy loading, and predicate push down, all of which make the reader more efficient and typically reduces wall clock time for a query. However as the code has changed significantly it may or may not introduce some minor issues, so it can be disabled if some  problems with environment are noticed. This property enables/disables all optimizations except predicate push down as it is managed by ``hive.parquet-predicate-pushdown.enabled`` property.


``hive.parquet-predicate-pushdown.enabled``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``Boolean``
 * **Default value:** ``false``
 * **Description:** *Deprecated* Serves as default value for ``parquet_predicate_pushdown_enabled`` sesssion property. See :ref:`hive.parquet-optimized-reader.enabled<parquet-optimized-reader>`.


``hive.parquet.use-column-names``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``Boolean``
 * **Default value:** ``false``
 * **Description:** Access Parquet columns using names from the file. By default, columns in Parquet files are accessed by their ordinal position in the Hive metastore. Setting this property allows access by column name recorded in the Parquet file instead.

.. _s3-max-connections:

``hive.s3.max-connections``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``Integer`` (at least ``1``)
 * **Default value:** ``500``
 * **Description:** The maximum number of connections to S3 that may be open at a time by the S3 driver. A higher value may increase network utilization when a cluster is used on a high speed network. However, a higher values relies more on S3 servers being well configured for high parallelism.

.. _s3-multipart-min-file:

``hive.s3.multipart.min-file-size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``String`` (data size, at least ``16 MB``)
 * **Default value:** ``16 MB``
 * **Description:** This property describes how big a file must be to be uploaded to an S3 cluster using the multipart upload feature. Amazon recommends using ``100 MB``, but a lower value may increase upload parallelism and decrease the ``data lost``/``data sent`` ratio in unstable network conditions.

.. _s3-multipart-min-part:

``hive.s3.multipart.min-part-size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``String`` (data size, at least ``5 MB``)
 * **Default value:** ``5 MB``
 * **Description:** Defines the minimum part size for upload parts. Decreasing the minimum part size causes multipart uploads to be split into a larger number of smaller parts. Setting this value too low has a negative effect on transfer speeds, causing extra latency and network communication for each part.


There are also following session properties allowing to control connector behavior on single query basis:

``orc_max_buffer_size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``String`` (data size)
 * **Default value:** ``hive.orc.max-buffer-size`` (``8 MB``)
 * **Description:** See :ref:`hive.orc.max-buffer-size <tuning-pref-hive>`.


``orc_max_merge_distance``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``String`` (data size)
 * **Default value:** ``hive.orc.max-merge-distance`` (``1 MB``)
 * **Description:** See :ref:`hive.orc.max-merge-distance <tuning-pref-hive>`.


``orc_stream_buffer_size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Type:** ``String`` (data size)
 * **Default value:** ``hive.orc.max-buffer-size`` (``8 MB``)
 * **Description:** See :ref:`hive.orc.max-buffer-size <tuning-pref-hive>`.


Hive Connector Limitations
--------------------------

:doc:`/sql/delete` is only supported if the ``WHERE`` clause matches entire partitions.
